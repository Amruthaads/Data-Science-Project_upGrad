Data Preprocessing:
Loading the dataset using pandas.
Handling missing values.
Dropping unnecessary columns.
Visualizing the proportion of churned and retained customers using pie chart and count plots.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualizing categorical variables against the target variable using count plots.
Visualizing continuous variables against the target variable using box plots.
Feature Engineering:
Creating new features such as BalanceSalaryRatio, TenureByAge, and CreditScoreGivenAge.
One-hot encoding categorical variables.
Scaling continuous variables using MinMax scaling.
Model Fitting:
Fitting various classification models such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM) with RBF and Polynomial kernels, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
Model Evaluation:
Generating classification reports for each model.
